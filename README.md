# Programin-Languages-3
Write a function and a program that calls this function in C. The function returns void and receives a

string as input and reverses the string by using pointer arithmetics. By using this function, your

program should carry out the following steps:

Ask the user to input a string
Call this function to reverse the input string
Display the reversed string
Do not use any square brackets [], and do not call standard library functions from inside the function.

You may use printf and scanf only in the main body of your program. You may write a small utility

function to calculate the string length but do not use strlen or any other standard library function.
